# My React App

This is a React application designed to manage weather settings using a context API. The application is structured to provide a clean separation of concerns, with contexts for managing application state and components for rendering the UI.

## Project Structure

```
my-react-app
├── src
│   ├── contexts
│   │   └── SettingsContext.tsx  # Defines the SettingsContext and SettingsProvider for managing application settings.
